### PART ONE
# find total difference between left column 
# right column when sorted from low to high

# sampleAns for Part One should be 11

# 2 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 + 5
# print(differenceTwoLists(sampleData))
# print(differenceTwoLists(inputData))

# find frequency of number in left list appears in right list
# mult frequency by each number in left list

# print(calculateSimilarity(inputData))


### REFLECTION:
# buildFrequencyMap wasn't working for the longest time - only finding 1 instance of each number
# thought it was because I wasn't building the map properly so I used a defaultdict
# defaultdict creates key-value pairs that are not found and sets them to 0 by default.
# This helps which helps handling keyErrors
# I fixed the problem by rereading the problem and realizing that I needed to iterate through rightList
# to find if num exists in leftList and update count accordingly

# TAKEAWAY: important to really understand a problem in order to solve it.
